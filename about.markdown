## Cristian Valencia  
Product Owner | Technical Lead | Mobile & AI

Product Owner with 10 years of hands-on experience in mobile app development and delivery. I have led the end-to-end launch of 10+ highly rated mobile applications for Android and iOS.

My experience spans cross-platform technologies such as .NET MAUI, FlutterFlow, UNO, Avalonia, Xamarin.Forms, as well as native development with Swift and SwiftUI. I am currently leading AI-driven initiatives focused on enhancing product intelligence and user experience.

With a strong technical foundation as a developer, I act as a bridge between engineering and business — aligning technical constraints with product strategy to drive pragmatic, well-informed decisions that balance business value, technical quality, and user experience.

As a Technical Lead, I focus on building high-performing teams with clarity of direction and ownership, empowering teams to confidently tackle complex product and technical challenges.

Customer-centric by mindset, I translate business goals into well-defined requirements while balancing scalability and feasibility to deliver high-quality digital products.
